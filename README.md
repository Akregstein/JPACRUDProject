JPACRUDProject

Description:

The goal for this project was to create a SQL database and integrate it into a web application. The user has a menu of options with which to interact with and modify the Country list database. The web user can view a full list of all countries in database, search for a country by it's database Id or a keyword and finally also has the option to add and delete countries from the database.

If the user selects to add a country they are prompted with a menu of text forms to fill out the specified table columns for each country object. The user can then view their created country in the list all countries option in the homepage which displays all available countries in the database and has hyperlinks to that lead you to that countries specifications.

Lessons Learned:

During this project I learned how to create a database using MySQL Workbench and integrate it into a full stack web application. It was my first time creating a full-stack database project alone and I encountered many pains and frustrations along the way. I struggled with some of the connections between mapping in my controller class and the appropriate syntax in my JSP files. I was very fortunate to have classmates to lean on when I ran into dead ends. While I don't feel fully confidant with all of this material yet, I do feel like the pains encountered during this project lead to some new understanding and learning.
